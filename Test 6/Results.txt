1. The results from Test 6 were very well. The LGBM model predicted the MVP winner for 15 out of the last 19 seasons correctly, while being correct 12 out of the last 12 seasons from 2013-2024.

2. Interestingly, I noticed the LGBM model only predicted incorrectly from 2008-2012, where it went 4/5 on predictions in those years.  
    - In 2008, when Candace Parker won, 25% of the votes came from fans, possibly accounting for the misprediction by the models. She was on the LA Sparks at the time which probably played a huge
    part in the voting, as Los Angeles teams in general usually have large and hardcore fanbases.

    - For 2009, most of the models predicted Lauren Jackson when the winner was actually Diana Taurasi. This could partially be due to the fact that the percentage of games started in the season
    is seen as the 30th most important variable to determining the MVP winner by the LGBM model, making it not have a huge impact. This means Lauren Jackson was most likely not docked enough for only 
    having played in 26/34 games that year, compared to at least 31/34 games played by the top 5 candidates. Unfortunately, most of the games she missed happened to be at the end of the season,
    making it difficult for her to be considered for the award.
    
    - The 2011 MVP winner was Tamika Catchings, yet the models predicted either Tina Charles or Sylvia Fowles, the 2nd and 3rd place winners of the award that year, respectively.  Looking into the
    matter, I believe this can be attributed to a couple extraordinary factors not accounted for by the model. In the 2011 season she became the WNBA all time steals leader, after averaging a whopping
    2.9 SPG in 4 prior seasons. She also led her own team in PPG, RPG, APG, and APG for the second straight year, while leading the Indiana Fever to 1st seed in the East, making her very deserving of the
    award even though by the numbers, Sylvia Fowles had a better year comparitively in most categories.


3. The main thing that stood out from the results of the NBA MVP award prediction model was that I had to add a negative weight for the WNBA players that had won MVP in the prior year, where on the other
hand the NBA model didn't have to be altered to specifically account for that.  This makes sense because since the inception of the WNBA, there has only been one player to ever win back to back mvps,
being Cynthia Cooper in 1997 and 1998, the first two years of the WNBA.  Since then, nobody has acheived the same feat.  On the other hand, NBA back to back MVP winners has happened 7 times since 2001, 
by 6 different players, making it much more likely for someone to win the award back to back in the NBA.  Nobody has won the award for the 3rd time in a row since Larry Bird in 1986.

4. There were some similarites in the top 10 most impactful feature variables for the NBA and WNBA models.  Seed, (WS/40,WS/48), PER, FGM pergame, and Team win PCT all made the top 10 in both models.
PER could be determined as the single most impactful factor in determining either league's MVP as it makes top 2 in each model.  
    
5. Out of the rest of the top 10, perhaps the most interesting is the advanced stat Defensive Rating. It is the 4th most impactful feature variable for WNBA MVP, yet not in the way one might think.  
It was discovered that the HIGHER the rating was, the LOWER the chance is of becoming MVP.  My first thought is simply that those with the highest Defensive rating are usually not the highest
producers on offense, which is the primary criteria voters look at first.  However, that doesn't mean MVP candidates have low Defensive Rating, instead it looks like most winners have an average 
Defensive Rating.

    Another interesting discovery is that out of the big 3, (Pts, Reb, Ast) assists have the least impact on MVP winner by far.  AST% was the 48th greatest influence for NBA MVP and 13th greatest for
WNBA MVP.  With an average of just under 7.5 APG over the last 10 seasons, this is 31% less than the league's leading APG value (10.8 average over last 10 seasons). The PPG average was 28.6 PPG among 
the past 10 NBA MVP winners, which was only 11% lower than the average of the highest scoring player in each of those seasons at 31.8 PPG.  

6. Seeing rebounds being highly favored over assists in the WNBA model supports the claim that the W is a league dominated by "bigs". There's only been one Guard (Diana Taurasi) to win MVP in the past 16
seasons.  Comparatively, the NBA has awarded a Guard with MVP honors 5 times in the past 16 seasons.  My belief as to why it's harder for Guards to win MVP in the WNBA is because they don't average a 
substantially larger amount of points per game than the best Forwards and Centers in the league.  Diana Taurasi, the last Guard to win the award, averaged 5.3 PPG more than the runner-up Tamika Catchings. 
I think it will continue to take differences in PPG similar to this for Guards to win over their Forward/Center counterparts.  Before Taurasi, it was Sheryl Swoopes in 2005, transforming the Houston Comets 
into a playoff team and averaging 1.0 PPG more than 2nd place winner Lauren Jackson.  Despite winning the award, she actually had LESS 1st place votes than Jackson and won in the closest MVP race in WNBA 
history, due to a higher amount of 2nd place votes. This further supports just how hard it is for a Guard to acheive MVP status in the WNBA.  

    To demonstrate that Guards also have to go above and beyond in the NBA to win the MVP award, I will briefly break down the last 3 winners. James Harden won in 2018, averaging a league high 30.4 PPG 
(2.9 PPG greater than 2nd place winner LeBron James).  Perhaps most notable about his season is that he led the Houston Rockets to 1st in the West winning an astonishing 65 games, making it one of the top 20
regular seasons performances in NBA history.  Before Harden, there was 2017 Russell Westbrook, winning the award averaging 31.6 PPG (6.1 PPG higher than the next non-guard runner-up Kawhi Leonard). His phenomenal 
season averaging a triple-double makes him deserving of the award without a doubt, yet further exemplifies the harsh criteria needed to be met by a guard to be crowned Most Valuable Player.  Moving on to 2016
Stephen Curry, the first ever unanimous MVP, Steph averaged 30.1 PPG, (8.9 PPG higher than the next contender) anchoring the Warriors to the absolute best regular season in NBA history with a 73-9 record.  

    Now that we know just how hard it is for Guards to win MVP, I will discuss my thoughts as to why.  Given that the Forwards and Centers of the WNBA/NBA are naturally bigger in size than Guards, they are 
usually more athletically capable of doing more things on the court.  Their difference in height, weight, and wingspan make it easier for them to get deflections, blocks, haul in rebounds, and even get better shot 
contests, usually leading to them having better defensive per-game and advanced stats, along with offensive and defensive rebounds.  The disparity in RPG between even the top rebounding Guards and the rest of
the league is glaring.  The highest RPG for the 2024 season belonged to Angel Reese with 13.1 RPG, (5.1 ORPG) and the closest to that mark was Caitlin Clark, averaging 5.7 RPG â€“ a huge difference!  Meanwhile, 
the highest APG count was recorded by Caitlyn Clark, who finished the season with 8.4 APG.  Not too far behind her was Alyssa Thomas, Forward on Connecticut Sun who averaged 7.9 APG, only 0.5 APG behind Clark.
Although only a single example, it shows at a basic level that Forwards are much closer to doing what Guards excell at than Guards are to doing the jobs of Forwards.  This explains a bit why Guards have to do 
their job exceptionally well to take home the Most Valuable Player award.
